  h1 Nylon 66 Raman spectra
    .box
      p The monomer unit of Nylon 66 is characterized by a Carbon-heteroatom backbone structure and by the presence of methyline, ketone and secondary amide functional groups.
      p Its monomer unit is:

      p The following spectra was obtained using a Thermofisher Raman microscope with a 50x objective and 532 nm laser.
      p The parametres used were 20 exposures, 1 sec exposures, no photobleaching, fluorescence correction. The spectra was processed using the SpectraGryph 1.2 spectroscopy software
