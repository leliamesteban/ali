  h1 PET Raman spectra
    .box
      p The monomer unit of PET is characterized by a Carbon-Heteroatom backbone structure and by the presence of esters, phenyl and methylene.
      p Its monomer unit is:

      p The following spectra was obtained using a Thermofisher Raman microscope with a 50x objective and 532 nm laser.
      p The parameters used were 20 exposures, 1 sec exposures, no photobleaching, fluorescence correction. The spectra was processed using the SpectraGryph 1.2 spectroscopy software.
